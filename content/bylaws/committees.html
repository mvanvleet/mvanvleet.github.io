<h1>Article Three — Committees<a class="headerlink" href="#article-three-committees" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h1>
<p><strong>3.1 The committee structure</strong> is the foundation of shared governance.
Spelman College Faculty and Staff must respect this structure by directing
issues, problems, and questions concerning areas of Faculty responsibility to
the Faculty Council or the appropriate Faculty Standing Committee.</p>
<p><strong>3.2 The committee structure</strong> provides the mechanisms through which the Faculty
participates in the governance of the College. The Provost and Vice President
for Academic Affairs works directly with the Faculty and serves as liaison
between the Faculty and the President in facilitating faculty efforts in
making and implementing policies and ensuring the effective functioning of the
College.</p>
<p><strong>3.3 Faculty Standing Committees</strong> shall be the primary vehicles through which
faculty governance is effected. Faculty Standing Committees are responsible to
the Faculty and provide regular reports to Faculty Council. All Faculty
Standing Committees shall be chaired by faculty members. Committees shall take
up issues, problems, and questions in the area of faculty responsibility when
such matters are presented by individual faculty, the Provost, staff, or other
working committee representative to the appropriate Faculty Standing Committee
or to Faculty Council, which may then send the matter to the proper committee,
the Provost, or call for an ad hoc committee, if appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>3.4 Ad hoc committees</strong> are established as needed by Faculty Council, the
Provost, or the President. When these Committees are formed by the Provost or
President, Faculty Council shall be notified. Faculty Council shall be
consulted in order to ensure proper representation of Divisions; to ascertain
that the proposed ad hoc committee is not duplicating or conflicting with the
work or mission of a Standing Committee; to assist Faculty Council in the
coordination of committee work and reporting. When the Faculty Council
establishes an as hoc committee, the Provost and the President shall be
notified. Formation of ad hoc committees, once reviewed, shall be announced at
Faculty Meetings, along with reporting responsibilities, when appropriate.
Each ad hoc committee may exist for no longer than three academic years and
shall be reviewed for incorporation as a Faculty Standing Committee if its
charge has not been completed in three years.</p>
<p><strong>3.5 Membership on Faculty Standing Committees</strong> shall be by election, with the
additional inclusion of specific administrators, Department Chairs, or Program
Directors on specified committees.</p>
<p><strong>3.6 General Principles and Regulations for Committees</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Certain committees are recognized as being especially demanding of the time
of committee members and require tenured status and at least two years of
service. These committees, referred to as “starred committees,” are
designated with an asterisk. If serving on two such committees, faculty
should minimize other service obligations.</p></li>
<li><p>A faculty member is encouraged to serve on no more than three non-starred
committees.</p></li>
<li><p>With the exception of the Faculty Council, the Tenure and
Promotion Committee, and the Curriculum Committee, Faculty Standing
Committees shall elect their own chairs or co- chairs by simple majority.
The Faculty elects the Faculty Council President. The Faculty Council, in
consultation with the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs,
appoints the chair of the Tenure and Promotion Committee. The Dean of
Undergraduate studies shall serve as convener and co-chair of the
Curriculum Committee; the second co- chair shall be selected from among the
elected faculty members of the committee.</p></li>
<li><p>The Faculty Council appoints a Parliamentarian. The Parliamentarian ensures
that Robert’s Rules of Order are maintained during Faculty meetings and
presents changes to the By- Laws and Faculty Handbook for faculty vote. The
Parliamentarian ensures votes and language are properly recorded by the
Secretary prior to the distribution of the minutes to the full Faculty.</p></li>
<li><p>The Faculty shall identify a Secretary. The Faculty Secretary’s sole
responsibility is to record faculty-meeting minutes and provide a draft of
the minutes to the Faculty Council. The Faculty Council shall distribute
the minutes to faculty prior to the next scheduled faculty meeting for
faculty review, and request approval of the minutes at the next faculty
meeting.</p></li>
<li><p>Each Faculty Standing Committee shall elect a chair or co-chairs from the
members. The Chair shall inform the Faculty Council of the committee
officers and contact information. The information shall be provided at the
beginning of each academic year in a written report, posted for future
reference. If a Chairperson resigns their office for any reason before the
regular term of service has been completed, a new Chairperson must be
identified and the Faculty Council informed of the change and provided new
contact information. The responsibilities of a Faculty Standing Committee
Chairperson include the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>To ensure that the Committee fulfills the responsibilities assigned to
it in the Bylaws;</p></li>
<li><p>To establish and follow policies and procedures governing Committee
operations, including a monthly report to the Faculty.</p></li>
<li><p>To provide committee members with a written agenda, preferably in
advance of each meeting;</p></li>
<li><p>To identify a recorder of minutes at each meeting and once approved,
post the minutes for the review of the Faculty on the secure faculty
website. The Tenure and Promotion Committee is exempted from the latter
requirement.</p></li>
<li><p>To assign other responsibilities among the Committee members to
facilitate the work of the Committee.</p></li>
<li><p>To ensure that the Committee makes and keeps a regular meeting schedule
and the meetings begin and end on time.</p></li>
<li><p>To record attendance as part of the minutes and address persistent lack
of participation among members.</p></li>
<li><p>To document the work of the Committee and its relevance.</p></li>
<li><p>To provide a written annual report of the Committee to the Faculty
Council prior to the Faculty Retreat.</p></li>
<li><p>To provide a written annual report that shall list the Committee members
and the nature of their participation, and shall include the Committee’s
accomplishments and minutes for the year.</p></li>
<li><p>To conduct meetings in accordance with Robert’s Rules of Order.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Initial terms of Committee membership are three years. The expiration of
terms shall be staggered. With the exception of the Tenure and Promotion
Committee and the Grievance Committee, members may be reappointed for two
terms - serving up to a total of nine consecutive years.</p></li>
<li><p>In the event that an elected faculty member cannot serve at any point their
term on a given committee for the entire year, the person with the next
highest vote in that divisional category shall be appointed for a year
term. If there is no replacement in that division, the person with the next
highest vote in the at-large category shall be appointed. Once the faculty
member returns that person shall resume their duties for the remainder of
the term. Standing Committee Chairpersons who go on leave should facilitate
the election by the committee or the appointment by Faculty Council of a
replacement Chair. (This replacement should finish the departing Chair’s
term). If the departing Chairperson is interested in fulfilling their term,
they may request in writing to Faculty Council that they be allowed to
return as Chair and finish the term once their leave is over. If possible,
this request should be submitted in conjunction with the notification of
leave so that the replacement Chair will know whether they are indeed a
replacement or serving in an interim capacity. However, these requests must
be evaluated on a case-by-case basis as some Standing Committee work might
be hampered by a change in chairs at crucial moments.</p></li>
