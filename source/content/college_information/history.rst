College History
===============

**Sophia B. Packard and Harriet E. Giles** were pioneers in the cause of women’s
education. Products of female seminaries, they were teachers and
administrators at schools in New England. With a commission from the women’s
American Baptist Home Mission Society (WABHMS), Packard and Giles came to
Georgia to start the Atlanta Baptist Female Seminary for women and girls. With
one hundred dollars from the First Baptist Church of Medford, Massachusetts,
and an offer from Father Frank Quarles to use the basement of Friendship
Baptist Church, the school opened on April 11, 1881 with eleven students --- ten
women and one girl --- determined to learn to read and write.

Packard and Giles returned North in 1882 to secure funds to buy a building for
the growing school. At a church meeting in Cleveland, Ohio they were
introduced to John D. Rockefeller, who pledged his support to the school. In
1883, the American Baptist Home Mission Society secured an option on nine
acres of land and five frame buildings, once used as army barracks by Union
troops during the Civil War. Through the philanthropy of Mr. Rockefeller, the
debt on the property was paid, and the school’s name was changed from Atlanta
Baptist Female Seminary in 1884 to honor the parents of Mrs. Laura Spelman
Rockefeller.

In 1886, Rockefeller Hall, the first brick building, was erected and the Nurse
Training Department was established. With funds from the Slater Fund, a
printing course began which produced the Spelman Messenger, the school’s
monthly paper. In 1887, six women completed the Higher Normal and Scientific
Course (High School). Through the vision and self-sacrifice of Sophia Packard,
the seminary was granted a state charter in 1888. The Board of Trustees was
organized, and Miss Packard was named Spelman’s first president. In the same
year, Packard Hall was dedicated.

Upon the death of Sophia Packard in 1891, Harriet E. Giles became the second
president of Spelman Seminary. Academically, the seminary added coursework in
Missionary Training, a Teachers’ Professional Course, and Domestic Science,
and continued to grow.

In 1897, the College Department was established. It awarded the first
baccalaureate degrees in 1901. Throughout this period the campus continued to
grow. Giles Hall was erected in 1893, Reynolds Cottage, MacVicar Hospital,
Morgan Hall, and Morehouse Hall in 1901, and Upton Hall in 1905. On November
12, 1909, Miss Giles died. Lucy Houghton Upton, Dean of the Seminary, was
appointed acting president.


**Lucy Hale Tapley** was elected the third president of Spelman in March 1910.
During the Tapley administration, the Teachers Professional Course, Home
Economics and Nurse Training curricula were strengthened. Bessie Strong Hall
was constructed in 1917 to house students in the nursing program, and the
Laura Spelman Memorial Building was constructed to house the new Home
Economics Department in 1918. In 1924, Spelman Seminary became Spelman
College, and began the gradual change from an academy to a liberal arts
college. Tapley Hall was erected in 1925 as the science building, and Sisters
Chapel was dedicated in 1927. Miss Tapley retired in 1927 after 37 years of
service to Spelman.

**Florence Matilda Read** was elected President of Spelman College on June 27,
1927. During her tenure as president, great impetus was given to the
institution’s development as a liberal arts college. The College made
substantial strides in its curriculum and organization. The High School,
Elementary School, and the Nurse Training Program were discontinued. The
Spelman Nursery School opened to provide practical training for student
teachers. An endowment was established.

In 1929, an “Agreement of Affiliation” between Spelman College, Morehouse
College and Atlanta University was signed, establishing the foundation of the
**Atlanta University Center**. In 1932, Spelman received an “A” rating from the
Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools and by 1947, met the
requirements of the American Association of Universities. During the Read
administration, the arts flourished at Spelman. Three more buildings were
added to the campus. Chadwick Hall was acquired from Atlanta University in
1945; Read Hall was dedicated in 1951, and Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Hall in
1953. Miss Read retired on July 1, 1953.

**Dr. Albert Edward Manley**, the first African American, as well as the first
male to serve as President of Spelman College, was appointed in 1953. During
his administration, there was a significant increase in enrollment, the
physical plant was enlarged, and a number of new academic programs were
developed. Dr. Manley saw the College through the unrest of the Civil Rights
Movement in the sixties, rounds of runaway inflation, and the feminist
revolution of the seventies. Students were encouraged to enter non-traditional
areas of employment, and were prepared to enter the best graduate and
professional schools in the country.  

The John D. Rockefeller Fine Arts Building and Dorothy Shepherd Manley Hall
were constructed in 1964, and Howard-Harreld Hall in 1968. In 1973, Sarah Sage
McAlpin Hall and the Albert E. Manley College Center were dedicated. Dr.
Manley retired after 23 years as president in 1976.

**Dr. Donald Mitchell Stewart** was named the sixth president of Spelman College
in April 1976. He made great strides in building on the College’s legacy of
achievement. Dr. Stewart strengthened the academic program and revised the
curriculum. He enhanced the faculty and significantly increased the endowment
from $9 million to $41million. Three new buildings were erected: the Donald
and Isabel Stewart Living/Learning Center I, Living/Learning Center II, and
the Academic Computer Center. In 1986, Dr. Stewart ended his tenure as
president. Dr. Barbara Carter assumed duties as Acting President, 1986-1987.

**Dr. Johnnetta Betsch Cole** became the first African American female president
of Spelman College on July 1, 1987. During her tenure as president, programs
designed to strengthen the ties between the College and local, national and
world constituencies were initiated. Campus programs were also strengthened,
and mentoring and community service programs were instituted. Spelman College
was nationally ranked among the best colleges in the country. Through the
philanthropy of William and Camille Cosby, the Camille Olivia Hanks Cosby
Academic Center was constructed in 1986. The Spelman Campaign: Initiatives for
the 90s was successfully completed, raising $113.8 million. Dr. Cole retired
in 1997.

**Dr. Audrey Forbes Manley** became the first alumna to serve as President of
Spelman College on July 1, 1997. As the eighth president of the College, Dr.
Manley focused on positioning Spelman for success well into the 21st century.
In 1998, the College was awarded a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, the nation’s
oldest and most prestigious honor society. The College was also accepted as a
provisional member of the NCAA Division III in basketball, volleyball, cross-
country, soccer, golf, and tennis. Construction of the new $30.8 million
Science Center and the renovation of MacVicar Hall were completed. While
encouraging a student-focused environment, Dr. Manley was also committed to
enriching the Spelman legacy of academic excellence, leadership, and service
through alumnae recognition and philanthropy.

**Dr. Beverly Daniel Tatum** was appointed the ninth president of the College on
July 1, 2002. A scholar, teacher, author, administrator, and race relations
expert, she brought 22 years of experience in higher education, liberal arts
education, and women’s education to the Spelman community. She was committed
to offering “Nothing less than the best” to those selected to learn and work
here. A champion of personal and environmental sustainability, Dr. Tatum
constructed a new LEEDS-Certified residence hall, which was subsequently named
for her; renovated the Laura Spelman building, now dedicated to the Social
Justice Program; and completed reconstruction of the Read Hall Wellness
Center, a feature of her initiative to transition from physical education
program to a holistic wellness program for students. Dr. Tatum retired in July
2015.

**Dr. Mary Schmidt Campbell** was appointed tenth president of the College on
August 1, 2015. An accomplished leader in higher education, Dr. Campbell
served as the Dean of the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University for
23 years. During her leadership, Tisch became one of the world’s premiere
schools of the arts, providing professional training in a range of disciplines
including film and television, the performing arts, new media, recorded music,
games and creative entrepreneurship. Dr. Campbell has begun leadership at
Spelman with a strategic plan designed to propel the College to the top tier
of distinguished liberal arts institutions. The elements of the strategic
outlook are as follows:

1. Execute a Graduation Contract with Each Student;
2. Institutionalize the Spelman Approach to Teaching and Learning;
3. Ensure Operational Excellence;
4. Support Academic Innovation.
